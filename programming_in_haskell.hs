  --3. Consider a function safetail :: [a] -> [a] that behaves in the same way
  --   as tail except that it maps the empty list to itself rather than producing
  --   an error. Using tail and the function null :: [a] -> Bool that decides if 
  --   a list is empty or not, define safetail using:
  --   a. a conditional expression;
  --   b. guarded equations.
  --   c. pattern matching.

(<||>) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
a <||> b = 
  if a == True && b == True 
     then True

  --6. Do the same for the following alternative definition, and note the difference
  --   in the number of conditional expressions that are required:

  --   False && _ = False
(<<||>>) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
a <<||>> b = 
  if a == True 
     then b 
     else  False

mult = \x -> \y -> \z -> x * y * z

  --8. The Luhn algorithm is used to check bank card numbers for simple errors such as mistypign a digit, and proceeds as follows: 
  --   * consider each digit as a separate number;
  --   * moving left, double every other number from the second last;
  --   * subtract 9 from each number that is now greater than 9;
  --   * add all the resulting numbers together;
  --   * if the total is divisible by 10, the card number is valid.
  --
  --   Define a function luhnDouble :: Int -> Int that doubles a digit and subtracts 9 if the result is greater than 9. For example:
  --   luhnDouble 3 = 6
  --   luhnDouble 6 = 3 = 6*2 - 9
  --
  --   Using luhnDouble and the integer remainder function mod, define a function luhn :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool that decides
  --   if a four-digit bank card number is valid. For example:
  --   luhn 1 7 8 4 = True
  --   luhn 4 7 8 3 = False 

luhnDouble :: Int -> Int
luhnDouble x | a > 9     = a-9

-- Decoding the caeser cypher is possible via a minimization of the chi-square statistic, which is

-- es are a list of expected frequencies
-- and n is the length of the two lists.

  --   sum [x^2 | x <- [1..100]]
  --2. Suppose that a coordinate grid of size m x n is given by the list of all pairs (x,y) of integers such that 0 <= x <= m and 0 <= y <= n.
  --   Using a list comprehension, define a function grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)] that retuns a coordinate grid of a given size. 
  --   For example:
  --     grid 1 2 = [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)]
grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int, Int)]
grid m n = [(x,y) | x <- [0..m], y <- [0..n]] 

  --3. Using a list comprehension and the function grid above, define a function square :: Int -> [(Int, Int)] that returns a coordinate square
  --   of size n, excluding the diagonal from (0, 0) to (n,n). For example:
mySquare :: Int -> [(Int, Int)]

  --4. In a similar way to the function length, show how the library function replicate :: Int -> a -> [a] that produces a list of identical elements can be defined

myReplicate n x = [x | k <- [1..n]]

  --5. A triple (x,y,z) of positive integers is Pythagorean if it satisfies the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2. Using a list comprehension with three generators,
  --   define a function pyths :: Int -> [(Int, Int, Int)] that returns the list of all such triples whose components are at most a given limit. For example:
  --   pyths 10 = [(3,4,5), (4,3,5),(6,8,10),(8,6,10)]

  --   define a function perfects :: Int -> [Int] that returns the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit. For example:
  --   perfects 500 = [6,28,496]
perfects :: Int -> [Int]
perfects n = [x | x <- [1..n], x == sum [x' | x' <- factors x, x' /= x]]

  --7. Show how the list comprehension [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]] with two generators can be re-expressed using two comprehensions with single generators.

  --9. The scalar product of two lists of integers xs and ys of length n is given by the sum of the products of corresponding integers:

  --   In a similar manner to chisqr, show how a list comprehension can be used to define  function scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int that returns
  --   the scalar product of two lists. For example:
  --   scalarproduct [1,2,3] [4,5,6] = 32
scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int
scalarproduct xs ys = sum [ x * y | (x, y) <- zip xs ys]
